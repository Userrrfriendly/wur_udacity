Would You Rather is a project for Udacity React NanoDegree.

It is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. Each user gets a point for either answering a question or by creating a question.

In order to run the project locally clone this repo and run `npm install` to setup the project.
After the installation run `npm start` to kick off the dev server.

That's all!
